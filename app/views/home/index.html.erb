    <h5 class="center">I was raised on my family's ranch in Montana. I lived in a village called Absarokee the population is around 1,300. I’m the kind of person who ponders on how things work. During middle school, if I was curious on how something worked I would YouTube or Google it. If that fail I took action, with some time you would see parts everywhere. I’m still the same but I know some things are better to leave to the professionals.</h5>

            In the first course I learned Git, GitHub, JavaScript, jQuery, Object-Oriented JavaScript. Now having those skills, our last assignment was a group project. We build a text adventure game. The game has a twist to it there are 4 levels. As a user you can navigate your character with arrows keys. While you are moving, there are randomly placed enemies though out the game. For our MVP this was just amazing to see what we could produce within a few weeks underneath our belts.
